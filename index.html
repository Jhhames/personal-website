            Hi! I'm James Falola, and this is my website.

        <o>
          Not sure what I'll be doing with this website yet, but I'm sure it'll
          come to me soon. I have some ideas already.
        </o>
        <p>
          As the name implies, it's going to be my website, containing my
          contact info, professional background, software engineering
          philosophy, engineering rants, some interesting projects I work on in
          my free time as well as talking shit about Man United every now and
          then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll also like for this website to be an interesting project to build,
          I have this idea where I make it a themed website, if I'm doing that,
          I'll write about it and share.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be on the look out while I try to figure out how to put all of this
          together. ❤️
